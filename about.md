Hi! My name is Thomas. 

I am a doctoral candidate in Digital Media at Georgia Institute of Technology. For the time being my work is scattered: [personal site](http://theminutewaltz.com), [coroflot](http://www.coroflot.com/theminutewaltz), and [studio site](http://publicdesignworkshop.net)

## Areas of Study

My work focuses on design: I study designers; I engage in design research; I design.
