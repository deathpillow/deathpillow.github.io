<h2>Research Scientist at Georgia Institute of Technology in the Institute for People and Technology and the Center for Urban Innovation</h2>

<p>
My research focuses on (1) the future of work and (2) smart cities and civic technology. I am interested in the open government data, the professionalization of civic hacking, smart city technical assistance, and flexible work practices. I focus on questions related to design&mdash;how concerns are conceptualized, scaffolded, and represented&mdash;and affect&mdash;the embodied and relational qualities of activities, people, and situations.
</p>
<p>
I approach these interests through the lenses of the humanities, media and communications, design research, urban studies, human-computer interaction, and science and technology studies.  I take influence from workplace ethnographies, affect theory, production studies, and policy research.
