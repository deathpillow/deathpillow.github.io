<h2>Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Center for Urban Innovation in the School of Public Policy at the Georgia Institute of Technology</h2>

<p>
My research focuses on the contemporary work practices and the emerging prominence of civic technology. I am interested in questions about the role of design in organizations, the nature of public participation and civic duty, and the social, cultural, and personal impacts of flexible work.
</p>
<p>
I approach these interests through the lenses of the humanities, science and technology studies, media theory, design research/studies/management, and human-computer interaction.  I take influence from workplace ethnographies, studies of the everyday, and empirical design theory.
