I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the [Center for Urban Innovation](http://www.urbaninnovation.gatech.edu/) at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I am affiliated with the [Public Design Workshop](http://publicdesignworkshop.net).

My current research focuses on two areas:

1. *Contemporary labor practices around flexible work:* My interest in work began with my dissertation on the organizational impacts of user experience design. The dissertation work proposes that the ways design is theorized overlook important social, cultural, and institutional barriers to how organizations understand what constitutes work. Through participant-observation and semi-structured interviews, I argue that work comes to be through an organizationally defined ideology or culture given material form through artifacts, representations, routines, and practices. The main contribution of this research is the proposal for better attention to the political economy of design&mdash;how practices, techniques, and ideas from the fields of design circulate. This final claim led me to look more closely at the rising trend of coworking spaces as a new site of workplace ideology. Focusing on the United States, my research into coworking spaces aims understand how these spaces substantiate claims around the spaces increasing productivity, happiness, and employability amongst workers. I am engaging this research through the fields of computer-supported cooperative work, labor studies, and management. 

2. *The nature of public participation in the emerging domain of smart cities:* In recent years, civic participation within the United States has taken on a host of new forms from participatory budgeting to civic hacking. I initially began looking at civic hackathons to understand how these events do and do not make good on claims to engage the public and solve pressing issues. Tht research focused on ethnographic accounts of civic hackathons (what I termed issue-oriented hackathons) to understand the modes of production and participation that take place. In my current project I am looking at contemporary smart city convenings&mdash;including hackathons, but also workshops, charettes, panels, and the like&mdash;to unpack the ways these events construct participation and the public. I am engaging this research through the fields of design studies, urban studies, and civic media scholarship.

In general, my interests filter through the lenses of the humanities, science and technology studies, media theory, design research/studies/management, and human-computer interaction.  I take influence from workplace ethnographies, studies of the everyday, and design theory.

I am graduate of the [Digital Media program](http://dm.lmc.gatech.edu/) at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where I was advised by [Carl DiSalvo](http://carldisalvo.com/).
