On a recent trip to Chicago, I spent plenty of time on the "L." This network of elevated and subterranean local rail lines was a welcomed relief from the less-than-efficient local rails of Atlanta. Besides its efficiency and sheer novelty, I genuinely like being on public transit. Not being in control of where you spill into a city alleviates a great deal of frustration.
