"In Coleman’s (2013: 3) recent definition, hackers are ‘computer aficionados driven by an inquisitive passion for tinkering and learning technical systems, and frequently committed to an ethical version of information freedom’. This version of hacking certainly accompanied the latest app-fuelled tech bubble, whether in the life ‘hacking’ optimisation techniques in various quantification devices or the DIY ethos of the so-called maker movement (Hatch, 2014; Lindtner et al., 2014). As ‘hacking’ is enshrined in the parking lots, meeting spaces and wallpaper of multi-million dollar tech firms (Kovach and Goodman, 2013), as swathes of the Californian landscape are carved up and signposted with
roads called Hacker Way (the route to Facebook’s Menlo Park headquarters), as hacker residencies are advertised in municipal libraries and art galleries, and as chip companies invest in hackathons to motivate summer interns, we see multiple forms of evidence that hacking has become a cherished economic activity. Hacking’s self-directed qualities embody the desirable traits of today’s model employee." [187]

In reference to Gregg's hacking article:
[Something that is missing is the mythology of the untrained expert. Like many who have argued for an avant-garde in media or art, the un-training of one’s perception, skill, and thinking is precisely the goal. Hacking exists as an apotheosis of this mentality—the person breaking the box is the one who should make it. In the civic context, hacking ascribes to the idea that entrenchment is the problem (again to Gregg’s point about hacking existing in line with solutionism in a word where government is the problem. While professionalism is the end result, the cultural form of hacking as a type of amateurism is important—the civic or otherwise hacker is an identity that aligns with Florida’s idiotic statements that counter-culture has become the norm. The point is that it isn’t just that civic hacking provides grounds for a new type of portfolio professional, but is also constructs a type anti-professionalism.]
