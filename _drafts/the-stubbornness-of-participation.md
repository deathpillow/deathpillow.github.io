Atlanta has a pollen issue. While most cities experience an upswing in pollen counts in the Spring, Atlanta is particularly terrible. During the Spring months, the city becomes coated in a fine dusting of yellow: cars are yellow; ponds are yellow; shoes are yellow. Replacing small talk of weather is small talk of pollen. Allergy sufferers (if this is a classification of people at all) dread the Spring as much as fashionistos, car enthusiasts, cyclists, and a whole slew of other groups. Pollen is an issue in Atlanta not because it has impact, but because it mobilizes a heterogenous public to talk, complain, dust off, and otherwise deal with pollen. This is where a project I worked on through the [Public Design Workshop](http://publicdesignworkshop.net) (PDW) began.

To start before the beginning, I was part of a group of researchers and graduate students who wanted to engage with the "subjective" aspects of environemental sensing. While many within Science and Technology Studies (STS) would argue that all sensing is subjective, we were not interested in that arguement. The STS position explains that sensing (really any work which strives for objectivity) embodies and performs types of views which Donna Haraway labeled "views form nowhere" [^1] . Objectivity is not facts laid bear, but knowledge produced under a regime of methods, thinking, consenting communities, and complicit objects which all cooperate in a shared belief that the output is, in fact, a fact or truthful. Daston and Galison's amazing tome "Objectivity" provides a much richer account than I can ever do. The point is that my cohort at PDW were not interested in this meaning of subjectivity, but a more colloquial one: accounts of sensed things that escape quantitative measurement. We chose pollen precisely because pollen is measured, but such measurements seem to capture very little of the qualitative experiences of pollen.

Pollen is measured in a surprisingly literal way. Pollen count--the official number which corresponds to the gross particulate saturation of pollen in the air--is done through counting pollen. Using some collection devices (there are several), pollen is gathered from the air. These collected particles are then counted each day by an individual gifted in identifying types of pollen (trees, grasses, and weeds) and mold amongst a variety of other particulate matter. After gazing through a microscope and tallying marks, the day's pollen count is reported. So, the measurement of pollen results in a number called pollen count, which is literally a count of pollen particles. This description simplifies matters a bit, but illustrates an important point: pollen count has little to do with daily encounters with pollen.

After pollen has been counted, it is classified; here we begin to see some way of translating a number into something useful. There are four standard categories of pollen count——low, medium, high, and extra high——which correspond to four buckets of values——[0-14], [15-89], [90-1499], [1500+], respectively. These classifications are standards used by the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology's National Allergy Bureau. As is apparent, these buckets are not of equal size. The high classification, for example, spans two orders of magnitude; the extra high is an endless range. While these classifications may be meaningful in some scientific way (I assume only because they exist), they fail to be meaningful other than in an arbitrary way to everyday people. This is very apparent as pollen often greatly exceeds the extra high classification (fig 1) for Atlanta. A pollen count of ~2000 and ~8000 are both extra high, but calling them both extra high is not really very helpful.

Before moving on from the set up, one last point needs to be addressed: the pollen count *for* Atlanta is not actually *in* Atlanta; it is in Marietta. While Marietta is certainly within metropolitan Atlanta, to those living inside the perimeter (the ring formed by I-285), Marietta is outside the perimeter and thus outside the city.

In all these ways, we began to think about pollen differently. I will skip the
