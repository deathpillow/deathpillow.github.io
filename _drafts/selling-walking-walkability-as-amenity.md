On the homepage for the service [Walk Score](https://www.walkscore.com/) appears the tagline "Live Where You Love". Just below this grammatically confusing sentiment is a searchbar prompting the entry of an address, neighborhood, or city. Entering Atlanta, GA loads [an overview page of the City of Atlanta](https://www.walkscore.com/GA/Atlanta). At the top of this page are three numbers&mdash;Walk Score: 46; Transit Score: 43; Bike Score: 50&mdash;just above a map and description of the city. The outline the many corporations located in Atlanta, concluding by saying, "Many of Atlantaâ€™s neighborhoods have that 'small town in a big city' vibe that makes it a pleasant place to live, even if you have to commute." The description is followed by a button that reads "Nearby Apartments".

Walk Score is not the only service around. Walkanomics 

As one scrolls down each of these scores has its own section.

>Walk Score: 46. Atlanta is a Car-Dependent city. Most errands require a car.
>Transit Score: 43. Atlanta has Some Transit. A few nearby public transportation options. Find Atlanta apartments for rent near public transit.
>Bike Score: 50. Atlanta is Bikeable. Some bike infrastructure.

In a rather hidden About page[^1], the website explains its purpose:
>Walk Score's mission is to promote walkable neighborhoods. Walkable neighborhoods are one of the simplest and best solutions for the environment, our health, and our economy.

Below this mission statement is the following graphic depiction of the world Walk Score envisions.

The next section entitled "Our Vision" read:
>Our vision is for every property listing to read: Beds: 3 Baths: 2 Walk Score: 84. We want to make it easy for people to evaluate walkability and transportation when choosing where to live.


[^1]: The sole link to the About page appears in the footer menu/site map rather than the top navigation. The top navigation is reads "Find Apartments | Get Scores | My Favorites | Add to Your Site" with a right justified "Log in". Logging in allows a user to "Save favorites".
