On the homepage for the service [Walk Score](https://www.walkscore.com/) appears the tagline "Live Where You Love". Just below this grammatically confusing sentiment is a searchbar prompting the entry of an address, neighborhood, or city. I enter Atlanta, GA, which loads [an overview page of the City of Atlanta](https://www.walkscore.com/GA/Atlanta). At the top of this page, just above a map and description of the city, are three numbers&mdash;Walk Score: 46; Transit Score: 43; Bike Score: 50.  Without much context, these numbers assert that Atlanta is mediocre&mdash;middling on a hundred-point scale. The two paragraph overview of the city puts middling into words. After outlining the many corporations located in Atlanta, the overview concludes:

>Many of Atlantaâ€™s neighborhoods have that 'small town in a big city' vibe that makes it a pleasant place to live, even if you have to commute. 

The description is followed by a button that reads "Nearby Apartments". (Clicking it brings me to available residental listings.)

Further down this overview page are subsections for each score. The titles of sections read like (as I presume they are) autofilled copy on a dynamically generated page:

>Walk Score: 46. Atlanta is a Car-Dependent city. Most errands require a car.

>Transit Score: 43. Atlanta has Some Transit. A few nearby public transportation options. Find Atlanta apartments for rent near public transit.

>Bike Score: 50. Atlanta is Bikeable. Some bike infrastructure.

As a resident of Atlanta for close to 8 years, I can agree with the sentiments and judgements on this page. As an avid cyclist, walker, and public transit rider, I can confirm that Atlanta has mediocre pedestrian, cycling, and public transit infrastructure. Sidewalks in many neighborhoods are composed of hexagonal bricks that are up-turned by roots from the often tree-lined streets. Biking is hard in Atlanta&mdash;beyond the hills, heat, and humidity, traffic is dense and drivers are typically impatient. As for public transit in Atlanta (MARTA, Metro Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority), rail lines have very low saturation, and buses are rendered inconsistent by traffic and illegible by a lack of clear signage (there are other issues with MARTA for sure). All told, Walk Score seems to get the gist of Atlanta pretty well. But Walk Score (and other services like it[^1]) is troubling for a few reasons, the first of which is precisely what it is not: Walk Score is not a evaluation tool.

In a rather hidden About page[^$], the website explains its purpose:
>Walk Score's mission is to promote walkable neighborhoods. Walkable neighborhoods are one of the simplest and best solutions for the environment, our health, and our economy.

Below this mission statement is the following graphic depiction of the world Walk Score envisions.

The next section entitled "Our Vision" reads:
>Our vision is for every property listing to read: Beds: 3 Baths: 2 Walk Score: 84. We want to make it easy for people to evaluate walkability and transportation when choosing where to live.

In short, Walk Score is a tool for real estate. To be fair, Walk Score is not disguising its affiliations or leanings. The website and application (along with plenty of other indicators) are upfront that Walk Score is about the land market. What is hidden, at least in the phenomenological sense, is what Walk Score is doing by providing scores at the city, neighborhood, and street level.

First, Walk Score is not transparent about how a walk, bike, or transit score comes to be a number. For a user who enters a location on the homepage and numbers pop out on the other end, the mechanism are blackboxed. As much as
