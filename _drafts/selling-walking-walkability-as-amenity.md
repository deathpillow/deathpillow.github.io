On the homepage for the service [Walk Score](https://www.walkscore.com/) appears the tagline "Live Where You Love". Just below this confused sentiment is a searchbar prompting the entry of an address, neighborhood, or city. I enter Atlanta, GA. The browser loads [an overview page of the City of Atlanta](https://www.walkscore.com/GA/Atlanta). At the top of this page, just above a map and description of the city, are three numbers&mdash;Walk Score: 46; Transit Score: 43; Bike Score: 50.  Without much additional context, these numbers assert that Atlanta is mediocre&mdash;middling on a hundred-point scale of non-automotive transit. Just before the page break is button that reads "Nearby Apartments". Clicking it brings me to map and list of available residental listings in Atlanta, each of which has been pulled from a partner site, such as ForRent.com, Promove.com, or RedFin.com. On returning to the overview page I read the description Walk Score provides for Atlanta, which concludes, "Many of Atlantaâ€™s neighborhoods have that 'small town in a big city' vibe that makes it a pleasant place to live, even if you have to commute."

Walk Score, along with applications and services like it, [^2] are symptomatic of contemporary urban development that focuses on amenities. Under the regime of so-called ["new urbanism"](http://www.newurbanism.org/), ideas like walkability, mixed use zoning, and environmental sustainability, amongst others, have come to the contemporary markers of desireable urban areas. These features aim to produce dense, localized urban areas that        Rather than claiming anything about new urbanism on the whole&mdash;it is far from uniform as an idea&mdash;walkability in particular provides an entry point to unpack some of the latent tensions that exist within contemporary efforts in urban centers. To begin, let's return to Walk Score.

Unclear of what the Walk Score is, what the numbers come from, and why these have anything to do with real estate listings and after some digging[^1], I come to the About page for [Walk Score](https://www.walkscore.com/about.shtml). 
>Walk Score's mission is to promote walkable neighborhoods. Walkable neighborhoods are one of the simplest and best solutions for the environment, our health, and our economy.

While Walk Score seems to be some sort of advocacy group, the next section entitled "Our Vision" sets the record straight:
>Our vision is for every property listing to read: Beds: 3 Baths: 2 Walk Score: 84. We want to make it easy for people to evaluate walkability and transportation when choosing where to live.

In a rather tidy fashion, Walk Score provides a particular example of something much bigger. While Walk Score seems to be an evaluation tool, it is not. Instead, Walk Score is an amenity brokering service that uses the gestures of objective reporting to create a seamless pipeline between those in need of housing and those providing it. Walk Score approaches housing is that one makes choices about where to live based on what they want. For Walk Score, the city is a menu. Second, Walk Score is not for everyone, though anyone could use it. For many people, however, the city is anything but menu of options. While Walk Score claims to want to promote walkable neighborhoods, the service seems to mean promote those neighborhoods that are already walkable, ignoring that walking is important when the choice of where one lives is removed.

##What the fuck is walkability anyway?


##The City as Menu

Much of the Walk Score site appears in the form of evidence-based reporting, what might be conferred the catchall objective. For example, the overview page for Atlanta is broken into subsections for each of the aforementioned scores, as well as a section for that reports on crime and a section of personal testimonies about life in Atlanta. The titles of the score sections read:

>Walk Score: 46. Atlanta is a Car-Dependent city. Most errands require a car.

>Transit Score: 43. Atlanta has Some Transit. A few nearby public transportation options. Find Atlanta apartments for rent near public transit.

>Bike Score: 50. Atlanta is Bikeable. Some bike infrastructure.

The language used here is worth reflection (see todo)...

The various sections provide heat maps, ranked listings, pull quotes, images, and, of course, relevant real estate listings. 

As a resident of Atlanta for close to 8 years, I can anecdotally agree with the sentiments and judgements on this page. As a cyclist, walker, and public transit rider, I can confirm that Atlanta has mediocre pedestrian, cycling, and public transit infrastructure. Sidewalks in many neighborhoods are composed of hexagonal bricks that are up-turned by roots from the often tree-lined streets. Biking is hard in Atlanta&mdash;beyond the hills, heat, and humidity, traffic is dense, drivers are typically impatient, and bike lanes are rare (though increasing in numbers). As for public transit in Atlanta (MARTA, Metro Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority), rail lines have very low saturation, and buses are rendered inconsistent by traffic and illegible by a lack of clear signage (there are other issues with MARTA for sure). All told, Walk Score seems to get the gist of Atlanta pretty well. But Walk Score (and other services like it[^1]) is troubling for a few reasons, two of which I want to discuss here. 

While much of Walk Score seems to evaluate cities, neighborhoods, and areas, Walk Score might be better understood as a *brokering service*, sitting between the supply and demand of a local land market. The copy, images, and various other information reads like, as I presume they are, dynamically generated copy, produced using a combination of boilerplate language, scrapped and generated data, and computationally defined output fields. Some of this information comes from Walk Score's own proprietary tools, and most appears to come from elsewhere, such as partner sites and publically accessible databases. This computationally arranged madlib of information offers a comprehensive representation of a city, which in turn is supposed to inform how people make decisions about where they live. Conveniently, Walk Score provides listings from partner sites to reduce the effort of a potential resident. These listings are also a revenue stream for Walk Score. What is concerning is that while Walk Score appears as a depoliticized third party offering nothing more than aggregation and evaluation, Walk Score is brokering information for some particular, though unnamed, user group.



//todo
Explain 'objective' in this context. The tone of objectivity is cultivated by displacing the human. As such, the characteristics of walkability, bikeability, and public transit use are located in the objects of infrastructures of walking, biking, and public transit rather than the activities of walking, biking, and riding transit. In doing so, the walkability, that is the ability to walk, becomes a disposition of things rather than of people. Without mentioning the body, these terms become a mode of depoliticizing the terms of walkability, that is, infrastructural investment is never about the city as an object but the city as composed of subjects.

##Choosing What Is Left is Not Choosing At All

This final sentence&mdash;*We want to make it easy for people to evaluate walkability and transportation when choosing where to live.*&mdash;is truly the crux of my concern. The website and application (along with plenty of other indicators) are upfront that Walk Score is not a public service to make policy decisions, nor is it solely an evaluation tool. As much as Walk Score is not disguising its affiliations or leanings as a service, it is disguising its inherent socioeconomic bias, most present in the ideas of "Live Where You Love" and "choosing where to live." What is at issue is how Walk Score is deliberately framed as *ideological*, and how this ideological stance blurs the edges around the private service network brokered by Walk Score and depoliticizes somethings that are deeply political&mdash;space and place.

In the book *Place Matters*, authors Dreier, Mollenkopf, and Swanstrom explore income segregation. Using a wealth of data across the now three editions, the authors draw a strong and continuing conclusion&mdash;cities with low income diversity (that is, segregated by income) suffer from systemic problems that interrupt the basic rights of democractic citizens and impede regional economic development. This macro-level analysis has a micro-level shadow&mdash;where you live deeply impacts the opportunities you have. This micro-level conclusion may seem commonsensical, but Dreier, Mollenkopf, and Swanstrom explain that the interplay of this lack of opportunity and the health and wealth of regional economies are intimately tied together. Poor neighborhoods cannot be cordoned off as isolated problems for urban centers; poor neighborhoods have regional impacts and echoes. 

The authors over and again emphasize an underlying misconception with how income segregation is understand. Often times, where one lives is considered a choice. For poorer residents of city, where they live is simply not a choice. Even more, these residents often are doubly penalized, living in neighborhoods with few employment opportunities and having to commute to other urban and regional areas to work. Spending more time commuting and more time working than their counterparts elsehwere, such residents find it impossible to advance their conditions. In short, regardless of whether a service like Walk Score wants to make it easier for people to evaluate the conditions of where they live, for many people this evaluation does not come with a choice.
