On the homepage for the service [Walk Score](https://www.walkscore.com/) appears the tagline "Live Where You Love". Just below this confusing/confused sentiment is a searchbar prompting the entry of an address, neighborhood, or city. I enter Atlanta, GA, which loads [an overview page of the City of Atlanta](https://www.walkscore.com/GA/Atlanta). At the top of this page, just above a map and description of the city, are three numbers&mdash;Walk Score: 46; Transit Score: 43; Bike Score: 50.  Without much additional context, these numbers assert that Atlanta is mediocre&mdash;middling on a hundred-point scale of non-automotive transit. The two paragraph overview of the city puts middling into words, concluding:
>Many of Atlantaâ€™s neighborhoods have that 'small town in a big city' vibe that makes it a pleasant place to live, even if you have to commute. 

The description is followed by a button that reads "Nearby Apartments". Clicking it brings me to map and list of available residental listings in Atlanta, each of which has been pulled from a partner site, such as ForRent.com, Promove.com, or RedFin.com

As a resident of Atlanta for close to 8 years, I can anecdotally agree with the sentiments and judgements on this page. As a cyclist, walker, and public transit rider, I can confirm that Atlanta has mediocre pedestrian, cycling, and public transit infrastructure. Sidewalks in many neighborhoods are composed of hexagonal bricks that are up-turned by roots from the often tree-lined streets. Biking is hard in Atlanta&mdash;beyond the hills, heat, and humidity, traffic is dense, drivers are typically impatient, and bike lanes are rare (though increasing in numbers). As for public transit in Atlanta (MARTA, Metro Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority), rail lines have very low saturation, and buses are rendered inconsistent by traffic and illegible by a lack of clear signage (there are other issues with MARTA for sure). All told, Walk Score seems to get the gist of Atlanta pretty well. But Walk Score (and other services like it[^1]) is troubling for a few reasons, the first of which is precisely what it is not: Walk Score is not a evaluation tool.

Much of the Walk Score site appears in the form of evidence based reporting. For example, the overview page for Atlanta is broken into subsections for each of the aforementioned scores, as well as a section for crime and persona; testimonies about life in Atlanta. The titles of the score sections illustrate the point:

>Walk Score: 46. Atlanta is a Car-Dependent city. Most errands require a car.

>Transit Score: 43. Atlanta has Some Transit. A few nearby public transportation options. Find Atlanta apartments for rent near public transit.

>Bike Score: 50. Atlanta is Bikeable. Some bike infrastructure.

The various sections provide heat maps, ranked listings, pull quotes, images, and, of course, relevant real estate listings. While much of Walk Score seems to evaluate cities, neighborhoods, and areas, Walk Score might be better understood as an information brokering tool, sitting between the supply and demand of a local land market. The copy, images, and various other information reads like, as I presume they are, dynamically generated copy, produced using a combination of boilerplate language, scrapped data, and computationally defined output fields. In short, Walk Score is a madlib that uses the language of evaluation to h  To be fair, Walk Score is not disguising its affiliations or leanings, and I am not critiquing the service itself (at least not at this point). The website and application (along with plenty of other indicators) are upfront that Walk Score is about land markets. What is at issue is how Walk Score is deliberately framed as *ideological*, and how this ideological stance blurs the edges around the private service network brokered by Walk Score.

In a rather hidden About page[^$], the website explains its mission as follows:
>Walk Score's mission is to promote walkable neighborhoods. Walkable neighborhoods are one of the simplest and best solutions for the environment, our health, and our economy.

Below this mission statement is the following graphic depiction of the world Walk Score envisions.

The next section entitled "Our Vision" reads:
>Our vision is for every property listing to read: Beds: 3 Baths: 2 Walk Score: 84. We want to make it easy for people to evaluate walkability and transportation when choosing where to live.

This final sentence&mdash;*We want to make it easy for people to evaluate walkability and transportation when choosing where to live.*&mdash;is truly the crux of concern

First, Walk Score is not transparent about how a walk, bike, or transit score comes to be a number. For a user who enters a location on the homepage and numbers pop out on the other end, the mechanism are blackboxed. As much as
