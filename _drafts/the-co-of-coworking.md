Before I officially began researching coworking spaces, I had some exposure to what coworking spaces were and what coworking entailed. In very general terms, coworking spaces refer to a large category of short-term, privately-operated facilities that subdivide leased or owned space into smaller rentable units. These facilities offer month-to-month memberships or leases that are priced to entice small and medium businesses, freelance and contract workers, remote employees, and other people operating with low overhead in need of work space. While coworking often implies [hot desking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_desking)(non-exclusive open desks or work areas that are occupied as needed), coworking spaces as a category of work spaces often offer graduated memberships that include devoted desks and semi-private or private offices. Beyond space, members receive basic amenities with their membership, such as WiFi, printing services, coffee, and conference rooms, and can purchase additional amenities, such as mailboxes, storage, and additional conference room time. Beyond space and amenities, coworking spaces often claim to be creative and inspirational places to work. By being part of a space with a diversity of people and professions, the claim follows that members have access to professional and social support networks. As such, coworking spaces seem to claim that the collective identity of the space, i.e. the community, is beneficial to the individual careers of members.

What enticed me was less that these were a global cultural phenomenon (I now know such spaces are everywhere) and more that the term *coworking*&mdash;particularly the *co* part of coworking&mdash;was confusing given what I did know.
What did *co* mean exactly? Colocated? Collaborative? Cooperative? Collective? Communal? Maybe other people don't get quite as confused or confounded by terms as I do, but I have found confusion of this nature is very productive,[^!] so I have been following it.

The obvious answer was that *co* is just an English prefix, *co-* (|kəʊ|), that means: [^@]

1. with : together : joint : jointly <coexist>
2. in or to the same degree <coextensive>
3. 
..a :  one that is associated in an action with another :  fellow :  partner <coauthor>
..b :  having a usually lesser share in duty or responsibility :  alternate :  deputy <copilot>

Enlisting 3a, coworking spaces are spaces where people are "associated in an action with another", i.e. as coworkers, engaged in working *together* with others, i.e. coworking.  While this might suffice to explain the name, such a definition failed to find support in what I came to this research knowing.

As the general description highlights, coworking spaces are not traditional office spaces. Typically the term coworker refers people who work for the same company. To refer to someone as a coworker indicates an association through a shared working arrangement, often mediated by a company or organization. In other words, coworker is often the same as colleague. However, very few of the people working in coworking spaces work for the same company, and so this traditional use of the term *coworker* is akin to referring to someone as a *roommate* who lives in a separate house. While coworker qua colleague might alternately mean working for or with a shared goal (i.e. collegiality), the working arrangements of coworking spaces offer very little of a shared goal beyon  Instead, the term coworker in these instances seems to indicate people working alongside one another, that is, collocated workers. 


[^!]: I spend some 250 pages lamenting the term "user experience" in my [dissertation](http://thomaslodato.info/portfolio/the-work-of-user-experience-design/) after witnessing people use UX with so much confidence at a company called LTC. When I finally decided that I would follow the term as my dissertation topic, I recall naively/glibly telling my advisor that the main research question was "What the hell is the term user experience anyway?"
