The term *walkability* airs on the side of commonsense. In simplest terms, walkability means the ability to walk. Walkability is often defined in passing as similar to other notions like pedestrian friendliness, accessibility, and mobility, and is found conjoined with discussions and sentiments related to biking infrastructure, public transit ridership, and environmental consciousness. Walkability is both an ideal and an assessment, and something uniformly presented as a good thing. But other than the commonsense logic of walkability do we really know about walkability?

>Our vision is for every property listing to read: Beds: 3 Baths: 2 Walk Score: 84. We want to make it easy for people to evaluate walkability and transportation when choosing where to live.

The epigraph comes from the website for [Walk Score](https://www.walkscore.com/about.shtml), a private service that provides numeric assessments for pedestrian, cycling, and public transit mobility. 

>Walk Score's mission is to promote walkable neighborhoods. Walkable neighborhoods are one of the simplest and best solutions for the environment, our health, and our economy.
