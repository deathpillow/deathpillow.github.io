The uneasiness the term *design thinking* is the subject here. Rather than trying to unpack this queasy pairing historically or rhetorically (that is, an archaeology of the present), design thinking can be more basically unpacked as two words. This is an approach I have yet to see applied to a pair of terms that quite literally are two words but ratherly discussed both as being two and being words (as opposed to concepts). In this, we will begin.

Design thinking is two words: design and thinking. Each of these words has a conceptual history that is worth ignoring for a moment (in fact, for the entirety of discussion here) to focus on the more primative shape of the words qua words. Design is a noun and verb, and functions within design thinking as a modifier somewhere between adjective and adverb. Thinking is a gerund&mdash;that is, a verb that has been made into a noun&mdash;
