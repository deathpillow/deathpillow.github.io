While the 2002 film *Minority Report* takes place in 2054 A.D., the futuristic landscape of Steven Spielberg's film speculates on a techno-utopia that has echoes in the present, and not necessarily for the obvious reasons. Based on an eponymous short story by prolific science fiction author Philip K. Dick, *Minority Report* follows protagonist Jon Anderton (Tom Cruise), who works as part of a pilot crime-prevention program in the Washington D.C. metro area. As a detective in the Division of Precrime, Anderton stops murders before they happen. Using a highly sophisticated prediction system (see the video above for the film's explanation), Anderton's job is not simply knowing the intentions of individuals, but proving these intentions through detective work. As the film illustrates, precrime detective work is not that dissimilar to we typically would see in depictions of some (post-crime) detective work&mdash;enhancing photos for minute details, scrubbing through grainy video, and triangulating perceptions with other data sources to positively identify perpetrators. As much as  Anderton's work resembles surveillance work from the past (see "The Conversation" (Date) to "Blow Up" (Date)), the central premise of *Minority Report* is that evidence is set in the near future by way of a human-mediated prediction system. In other words, precrime is dependent on the reliability of predictive algorithms and the core tension of the film is the fuzziness of pre-determination. But the question of reliable prediction is not how the film resembles the present anymore than soothsaying in *Oedipus Rex* confirms the reliability of preditive algorithms.

Beyond the precrime system, *Minority Report* is filled with futuristic depictions&mdash;self-driving cars, personally addressed advertisements, genetically modified plants, and screens and projections everywhere. At the core of much of the film is a simple assumption: what would happen if computational technologies were everywhere? In many ways, everything in the film comes from this premise. It is the prevasiveness of computation that offers the most interesting speculation of the film, a speculation we can see in the contemporary discussion of Smart Cities. What if cities were a patina of computational stuff, meshing objects and bodies into data, algorithms, and dynamic landscapes? Then what?

##Sentient Cities: Ambient intelligence and the politics of urban space##

The article *Sentient Cities: Ambient intelligence and the politics of urban space* (2007) written by scholars Mike Crang and Stephen Graham, provides a way of parsing the vision depicted in *Minority Report*. Published in *Information, Communication, and Society* (10(6), 789â€“81), the article explores "the possibilities which open up when the city becomes a haze of software as much as being bricks and mortar". Building off the well-worn critique that information and communication technologies (ICTs) are not geographically homogeneous, the authors probe how do ICTs change the way we envision a city. In particular, the article looks at the rise of ubiquitous computing technologies, which now are colloquially discussed under the amorphus labels of Internet of Things, wearables, and mobile technologies. In a broad way, ubiquitous computing is a grouping of computational research that focuses on computing distributed into, onto, and through the world.

For the authors ubiquitous computing offers four potential avenues of how computing becomes ubiquitous. 

"[Computational technology is not] a mere passive backcloth for social action [...] At the very least the [smart] environment has always recursively influenced and been influenced by action [thus changing...] the temporality of that action."

Augmented Space: dynamic & legible overlays 
Enacted Space: embodied and bodied compu3ng 
Transducted Space: data-fying the city
Connected Space: communica3ve & connected stuff
