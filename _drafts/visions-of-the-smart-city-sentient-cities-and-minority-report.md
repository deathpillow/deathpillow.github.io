At the time of its release, the film *Minority Report* (2002) marked an important representation of the future yet-to-come for scholars of tangible computing, design studies, media studies, human-computer interaction and slew of other disciplines.  Based on a short story by Philip K. Dick with the same title, the film's main protagonist, Jon Anderton (Tom Cruise) works as part of an pilot crime-prevention program in the Washington D.C. metro area. As a detective in the Division of Pre-Crime, Anderton stops crimes before they happen. Using a highly sophisticated prediction system, Anderton's job is not simply knowing the intentions of individuals. Instead, his precrime detective work is not that dissimilar to we typically would see in depictions of some (post-crime) detective work&mdash;enhancing photos for minute details, scrubbing through grainy video, and looking for concrete identification of suspects, motives, and locations. In many ways, Anderton's work resembles depictions of surveillance work from "The Conversation" (Date) to "Blow Up" (Date). In this way, *Minority Report* depicts a future that resembles the past. 

The true innovation is the brains of the operation&mdash;three people suspended in a milky liquid referred to as Precogs. Through seemingly magical means, the visions of these individuals predict

While the premise of the movie hinges on the reliability of prediction, an ageless question about human character, the film is more than 2002 with the addition of predictive crime algorithms. 

##Sentient Cities: Ambient intelligence and the politics of urban space##

The article *Sentient Cities: Ambient intelligence and the politics of urban space* (2007) written by scholars Mike Crang and Stephen Graham, provides a way of parsing the vision of the Smart City depicted in *Minority Report*. Published in *Information, Communication, and Society* (10(6), 789â€“81), the article explores "the possibilities which open up when the city becomes a haze of software as much as being bricks and mortar". Building off the well-worn critique that information and communication technologies (ICTs) are not geographically homogeneous, the authors probe how do ICTs change the way we envision a city. In particular, the article looks at the rise of ubiquitous computing technologies, which now are colloquially discussed under the amorphus lable of Internet of Things. In a broad way, ubiquitous computing is a grouping of computational research that focuses on computing distributed into, onto, and through the world.

For the authors ubiquitous computing offers four potential avenues of how computing becomes ubiquitous. 

"[Computational technology is not] a mere passive backcloth for social action [...] At the very least the [smart] environment has always recursively influenced and been influenced by action [thus changing...] the temporality of that action."
