["The Message"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Message_(Grandmaster_Flash_and_the_Furious_Five_song)) was released in 1982 and is credited to Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five with features from Melle Mel and Duke Bootee. While the credit and legacy of "The Message" is assigned to Grandmaster Flash, the song came into existence under a swirl of circumstances.[^1] Originally conceived by house drummer for Sugar Hill Records, Ed Flechter (who rapped under the pseudonym Duke Bootee), Grandmaster Flash was uninterested, even with the prodding of Sugar Hill head, Sylvia Robinson.[^2] Despite Robinson's insistance and instincts (eventually proving to be accurate), Grandmaster Flash thought the song was too slow, forcing the grim lyrics front and center. Flash eventually signed on, only later to dispuste the copyright. While the production story of "The Message" had a lasting impact on hip-hop, the form of the song had and has lasting reverberations&mdash;foregrounding lyrics shifted attention from DJs to MCs within hip-hip, thereby marking a shift in the what music's expressive pillar was.[^3]

Like the shiftThe legacy of "The Message"


During class, I mentioned the film "Escape from New York" (1981) as an example of a future vision of a/the city (NYC in this case) from the past. The trailer is here (https://youtu.be/8-LDW7tWwAI). These sorts of visions are, obviously, not to be taken literally, but provide us with artifacts of cultural imaginaries of what cities were perceived as. At the time of the film, NYC had concerns with gang violence and graffiti, peep shows dominated Time Square, and the city had huge issues with resource allocation to many communities. In many ways, governance was struggling. "Escape from New York" (like other films of the time, say, "Warriors") extrapolates ideas from the late 1970s and early 1980s of these problems—crime will overtake the city and so in the future NYC will be a penal colony (a large Alcatraz). These media objects provide a glimpse of some people's view of NYC. 

Keep in mind, not everyone thought the city was a wasteland, though that perception seemed to garner more media attention, especially in the sense of these issues as problems to be solved. At the same time, Hip Hop was being born in the South Bronx. Two years after the release of "Escape from New York," Grandmaster Flash rapped about community poverty, governmental neglect, and gross police violence, as well as internal community revival in "The Message." (1983) (https://youtu.be/gYMkEMCHtJ4) While the image of NYC being troubled exists in both "Escape from New York" and Flash's "The Message," it is worth comparing how the problems are being presented, who seems to be relaying that message, and what they are suggesting the outcome could/should be. 

[Also to note, then-called Puff Daddy sampled "The Message" heavily for "Can't Nobody Hold Me Down" (1997) (https://youtu.be/qMh_VsTuXtE). P. Diddy's song is emblematic of 90s maximalism in Hip Hop, and the sample speaks wealth, luxury, and triumphantly succeeding against odd stacked against him. In reference to "The Message," "Can't Nobody Hold Me Down" is almost response for Grandmaster Flash—look how far we have come.]

She is credited with assembling the studio rap group, Sugar Hill Gang, who recorded the chart-topping song "Rapper's Delight". Like "The Message", "Rapper's Delight" was creation of Robinson's savvy&mdash;lyrics were collected and combined from various rappers and given voice by a studio ensemble. The
