The lack of diversity in the computational technology industry is no mystery. While U.S. companies are required to report employee diversity statistics to the government, in recent years many, if not all, have turned this reporting into an event itself. Rather than the dry reporting of equal employment opportunity   (http://www.eeoc.gov/employers/eeo1survey/faq.cfm, note the 100+ employee threshold) [notes: gender, comp tech,]

Workplace diversity will never change the conversation if the conversation's terms are not changed themselves.

From an open letter from Tim Cook "We are proud of the progress we’ve made, and our commitment to diversity is unwavering. But we know there is a lot more work to be done.

Some people will read this page and see our progress. Others will recognize how much farther we have to go. We see both. And more important than these statistics, we see tens of thousands of Apple employees all over the world, speaking dozens of languages, working together. We celebrate their differences and the many benefits we and our customers enjoy as a result."[http://www.apple.com/diversity/](http://www.apple.com/diversity/)

##Discounting expertise and "discount experts"
In a noisy tapas restaurant in Atlanta, Georgia, Steve provides some historical perspective on social science research at his company. Steve is a human factors engineer and works at LTC, a multinational computational technology company that has long specialized in engineering and manufacturing components and subsystems for computing systems. I spent six-months at LTC, embedded as a user experience researcher in order to observe the work practices of designers, engineers, managers, and other employees. While LTC is known for engineering, engineering does not necessarily account for the social, historical, or cultural processes important to understanding and making new computing products. As Steve explains, over the last twenty years, LTC has increased the number of social science researchers to provide insight as much as attention to concerns outside of the scope of technical engineering. In recent years, social science research has fallen under the label of "user experience," an amorphous term and agenda that foregrounds the situated, contingent, and lived realities of users of computational systems. While I learned a great deal about the company's relationship with the social sciences while at LTC, Steve offers his lived experience of the many growing pains of working in an environment that was and is hostile to his contribution to the design and development of computational systems.[^1]

Much of what Steve tells me recounts how his position as a human factors engineer morphed over time from mitigating errors to improving usability to supporting the desireous and aspirational qualities of people with products. While he still refers to his background as human factors engineering, his work now more closely aligns with the ethnographers, sociologists, cultural theorists, and design researchers he manages on his team, the Lab for Experience Research (or LER). In many of the descriptions, Steve constantly returns to the huge thorn in his side for the 20-some years he has worked at LTC&mdash;the methods he uses and their contribution to the design, engineering, and development of LTC's products are frequently subjected to scrutiny and doubt. In a particularly emotional account, Steve recounts:

*In fact one time one guy told me "You seem to know what you are doing. You’re helpful." This is a guy who I [had] been working with [for a while at this point] "This is helpful." And I looked at him and was kind of like [...] "Fuck you, what do you mean this is useful? [...] Of course it is useful. What do you think I am spending my time doing?" [...] I came to [LTC] from [a telecom company and] when I got my PhD, my officemate put doctor on my name plaque. [...] And then there was this "You're actually useful" [comment]. [...] And then he said "But these other people, they’re not so useful." {I responded, "Oh, that’s because they don’t know what they are doing. They were just appointed as usability people. They were tech writers. That's like me making [you] an electrical engineer. Why do you think [you] would be useful?" He was like "That’s a good point." Yes, it was a good point.*

Underriding Steve's account is that worse than his work being questioned frequently was that others felt that anyone could simply do it. He explained the problem as an issue of how what he did came across:

*[Social science researchers] use words and we make judgements. Now we might use words and make judgements based on theoretical background or based on [empirical field work] or based on data we might know from the literature, but we don’t explain all of that all the time like an electrical engineer doesn’t explain the theory of a transistor every time they pop a transistor onto a diagram. [...] So [some] think that [what we do is] just words, so they think that they can do it.*



Recently, his focus had become known as user experience&mdash;an amorphous and wide-reaching charge to understand current and future products in more comprehensive and contextual ways. Steve, like many other employees, told me that user experience was simultaneously discounted and desired within LTC. UX challenged many accepted assumptions, and required teams to be accountable to new ways of doing product design and development. While UX design and research offered intriguing opportunities for the company (at these opportunities were why it was introduced), employees struggled with having their core assumptions cast aside, both in terms of what to make and how to make it. As such, a variety of measures were put in place "to protect [UX designers' and researchers'] decisions [in order to] lead our strategy and decision-making from the user-experience perspective". (fieldnotes 07.17.2013, UX Council meeting [Katrine])

During my field work, I often witnessed how UX was challenged. One of the most prevalent ways of discounting proposals took the form of *Well, my wife...* followed by some form of rebuttal. I asked Steve about this trope, and he responded with a laugh: 

>What’s interesting about the wife example...It started out as, ah, let me see if I can get this right. In the '90s, people [would] say "Well, my grandmother wouldn't do this." And then, as time went on, it was "My wife won't do this." Now it’s "My daughter won't do this." So basically it’s always a woman who doesn't understand something. And it’s always a woman relative to them [...] relative to their position, right.

Within the computational technology industry, the disparity between male and female employees is rather well documented (along with disparities related to persons of color, class, and geographic representation).
