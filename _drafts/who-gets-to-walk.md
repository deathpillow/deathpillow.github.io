In 1982, the band Missing Persons released a song titled "Walking in L.A." [^1] on their debut album, *Spring Session M.* Quintessentially new wave, the song brims with alien synths, power riffs, and the shreaking stocatto of their female lead singer, Dale Bozzio. The lyrics open with a person passing through the city by car, questioning what she sees as she moves quickly through Los Angeles. She sures herself against what can be nothing other than a figment of her imagination: "I won't be fooled by a cheap cinematic trick/It must have been just a cardboard cut out of a man." The chorus enters after a short, four-line first verse: "Walkin' in L.A./Walkin' in L.A., nobody walks in L.A." Her eyes must be playing tricks on her. Cops don't walk "the beat" in L.A.; residents don't walk unless they "just ran out of gas"; kids and mothers take utilize carpools to remain isolated from the streets. As much as the song claims that nobody walks in L.A., it also catalogs who *does* walk in L.A. The image of a man on the street must be a cardboard cut-out, a lost pedestrian, or unfortunate motorist because L.A. is crawling with "freeway strangler[s]", "shopping cart pusher[s]", hippies ("someone groovie"), and unnamed street dwellers who aren't "starring in the movies". While the song claims that nobody walks in L.A., *nobody* means nobody respectable, sane, or productive, and certainly nobody that has other means of move through L.A. In L.A., walking is something left to the unfortunate dreggs of society.

While "Walking in L.A." has no aspirations of political commentary about 1980s urban areas, it highlights the important relationship between how we move and how we imagine movement. Stating that "nobody walks in L.A." is a statement that nobody imagines moving through L.A. by foot&mdash; walking is simply something that culturally performed as not happening, regardless of whether it does. In an article comparing the impact of perceptions about walking and driving in Aukland, New Zealand, scholars Bean, Kearns, and Collins explain that 
>"The term ‘automobility’ has been coined to describe the ways that the car has reconfigured social life, especially in cities, by transforming our ways of organising, moving through and living in time–space (Beckmann, 2001; Freund and Martin, 1993; Sheller, 2004; Sheller and Urry, 2000; Taylor, 2003; Urry, 2004)." [^3]

As automobility has become dominant, other forms of mobility (including walking, cycling and public transport) have been subordinated (Sheller and Urry, 2000). Walking has been replaced with sitting, riding and driving, and has been predominantly reconceptualised as an inconvenient, slow mode of travel. Indeed, for many, not having to walk has become an important marker of socioeconomic success (Amato, 2004)."

The authors continue 

For the song, walking is not an option not because of elitist claims about car ownership or distended social ties[^3] requiring motorized transport. Instead, walking is not an option because walking exposes the one's body to the dangers of the world. In the case of the song, those dangers are other bodies&mdash;people of various sorts with motives. While we might imagine contemporary cities as fundamentally different than those of 1980s[^2], the relationshop between movement and bodies is something that is never eraseable, no matter how much new development emphasizes walkability.

In her collection of essays titled "Men Explain Things to Me", Author Rebecca Solnit explains "Think about how much more time and energy we would have to focus on other things that matter if we weren't so busy surviving. Look at it this way: one of the best journalists I know is afraid to walk home at night in our neighborhood. Should she stop working late? How many women have had to stop doing their work, or been stopped from doing it, for similar reasons?"
