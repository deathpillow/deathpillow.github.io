In 1982, the band Missing Persons released a song titled "Walking in L.A." on their debut album, *Spring Session M.* Quintessentially new wave, the song brims with alien synths, power riffs, and stocatto vocals of their female lead singer, Dale Bozzio. The lyrics open with a person passing through the city by car, questioning what she sees as she moves quickly through Los Angeles. She sures herself against what can be nothing other than a figment of her imagination: "I won't be fooled by a cheap cinematic trick/It must have been just a cardboard cut out of a man." The chorus enters after a short, four-line first verse: "Walkin' in L.A./Walkin' in L.A., nobody walks in L.A." Her eyes must be playing tricks on her. Cops don't walk "the beat" in L.A.; residents don't walk unless they "just ran out of gas" or are lost; kids and mothers take utilize carpools to remain isolated from the streets. As much as the song claims that nobody walks in L.A., it also catalogs who *does* walk in L.A. The image of a man on the street must be a cardboard cut-out, a lost pedestrian, or unfortunate motorist because L.A. is crawling with "freeway strangler[s]", "shopping cart pusher[s]", hippies ("someone groovie"), and unnamed street dwellers who aren't "starring in the movies". While the song claims that nobody walks in L.A., *nobody* means nobody respectable, sane, or productive, that is, noboday worth mentioning. Even more, nobody walk who has other means of move through L.A. In L.A., walking is something left to the unfortunate dreggs of society.

While "Walking in L.A." has no aspirations of political commentary about 1980s urban areas[^1], it highlights the important relationship between how we move and how we imagine movement. Stating that "nobody walks in L.A." is a statement that nobody, at the time, imagined moving through L.A. by foot&mdash; walking was something that culturally performed as simply not happening, regardless of whether it did (even for "nobodies"). In an article comparing the impact of perceptions about walking and driving in Aukland, New Zealand, scholars Catherine Bean, Robin Kearns, and Damien Collins explain that cars are more than a means of transit, "reconfigur[ing] social life, especially in cities, by transforming our ways of organising, moving through and living in time–space".[^3] They use the term "automobility", a term coined elsewhere, to describe this larger car-dominated sociocultural reconfiguration. 

Automobility is very much akin to how Marshall McLuhan describes media[^2]&mdash;cars shift how we experience and understand the world by changing what we can do, what we expect, and what we imagine is possible. While the car is obviously important to the notion of automobility, automobility is found well-beyond how people use cars. Bean et al. continue that, 
>As automobility has become dominant, other forms of mobility (including walking, cycling and public transport) have been subordinated (Sheller and Urry, 2000). Walking has been replaced with sitting, riding and driving, and has been predominantly reconceptualised as an inconvenient, slow mode of travel. Indeed, for many, not having to walk has become an important marker of socioeconomic success (Amato, 2004)."[^4]

Bean et al. explain that automobility is socially constructed through the its r(re)production in values, spaces, and social ties. 

As a pervasive ordering of the world, automobility recasts other modes of transit while reinforcing its value structures. Bean et al. argue that automobility leads to an "intense flexibility", allowing individuals to live within extended, distended, and on-demand social relations that "social life would be impossible without a car." [^5] As such, automobility has a shadow that echos through ideas like "nobody walks in L.A."&mdash;nobody walks in L.A. who wants to *participate* in society. Even more, automobility is embedded in the ways we live, and is performed in the decision to drive as much as if, and when, to walk.

The cultural imaginaries of mobility form a great deal of what we do and don't do (or don't want to do) in contemporary cities. In recent years under the banner of "new urbanism," walking and so-called walkability have become common terms, if not priorities, within discussions of transit. A new cultural imaginary is being advanced. For example, in August 2015, Los Angeles passed their ["Mobility Plan 2035"](http://planning.lacity.org/documents/policy/mobilityplnmemo.pdf)("the Plan").[^6] The Plan outlines 20 years of phased multi-modal urban redevelopment. Central to the plan is the idea of "complete streets." Quoting a January city council motion, the document reports:
>“Complete streets” take into account the many community needs that streets fulfill. Streets do not just move people from one location to another. They provide a space for people to recreate, exercise, conduct business, engage in community activities, interact with their neighbors, and beautify their surroundings. Complete streets offer safety, comfort, and convenience for all users regardless of age, ability or means of transportation. They also lead to other public benefits, including improved transportation, a cleaner environment, and healthier neighborhoods.[^7]

As a framing for the L.A. plan, complete streets emphasize walking as a central activity for both transit and leisure, as well as an activity necessary to build stronger communities and healthier cities. While the contribution of walking to community health and interpersonal connectivity is debatable,[^8] the claims within the Plan are arguments for a different ideal, one that is certainly contestable but no more contestable than than the "impossibility" of living without a car. Countering the ethos that "nobody walks in L.A.", the Plan argues that not only *do* people walk in L.A. (the City has just not done much to help them out) but more people should and would if the city supported it. The Plan prioritizes the needs of mobilities other than cars and constructs a narrative frame in light of [critiques](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/08/us/a-los-angeles-plan-to-reshape-the-streetscape-sets-off-fears-of-gridlock.html?_r=0)&mdash;opposing the Plan opposes public health, local economic growth, environmental sustainability, and community well-being.

By making walking a greater priority and supporting it with infrastructural and  cultural development, one might ask, 

>"Who wouldn't walk in L.A.?"

Underlying the Missing Persons' song and invisible from many discussions of automobility, walkability, and transit in general is the walking body, i.e. the walker. In the song, the "cinematic trick" is not that someone is walking per se, but that someone might willingly be exposed the dangers of the world. In the case of the song, those dangers are other bodies&mdash;people of various sorts with motives. While we might imagine contemporary cities as fundamentally different than [those of 1980s](http://gothamist.com/2014/01/14/photos_revisit_the_seedy_times_squa.php), the relationshop between movement and bodies is something that is never eraseable in time or space, no matter how much new development emphasizes walkability. Most importantly, regardless of efforts to make walking a priority, one must always ask the question: 

>"Which bodies get to walk, and where?"

While we might consider the ways a city is and is not physically and socioculturally disposed for an activity, the city's construction is one of many forces at work. Who walks is always answerable with a slew of caveats, some that are tied landscapes and other to bodies themselves. For example, the following exchange comes from the aforementioned article by Bean et al.

Striking about this exchange is the context of walking described and what is not mentioned in the subsequent conclusions. The article uses this exchange to illustrate that walking and socializing go hand-in-hand, and even to support claims that walking leads to greater community socializing. The authors fail to mention any discussion about who is involved in this conversation ("Elle" is, presumably, the sole woman involved), and how the outcomes drawn might have skewed by virtue of inherent biases like gender, race, and socioeconomic status. Without reading into this exchange more than is there, the exchange presents more questions than answers about views on walking.

In her collection of essays titled "Men Explain Things to Me", author Rebecca Solnit explains what seems absent in other discussions. In an essay about violence and gender, she presents the following:
>"Think about how much more time and energy we would have to focus on other things that matter if [women] weren't so busy surviving. Look at it this way: one of the best journalists I know is afraid to walk home at night in our neighborhood. Should she stop working late? How many women have had to stop doing their work, or been stopped from doing it, for similar reasons?"

Solnit cuts to the heart of the matter, here in terms of gender. Walking isn't something that is simply a matter of having sidewalks and streetlights. To walk is to be exposed to the world, and that exposure is unevenly distrubted to different people. Other forces are play in who walks ([even in the daytime](http://www.ihollaback.org/)). While Solnit is concerned with the gendering of behavior[^9], gender is only one dial to turn. Race, as the ACLU points out ["driving while black"](https://www.aclu.org/report/driving-while-black-racial-profiling-our-nations-highways), impacts who is allowed to do what where.
