In the business and management world, a great deal of attention is devoted to producing, supporting, and sustaining collaboration. It seems popular business and management publications often claim collaboration is a secret ingredient to market success&mdash;["Collaborate to Win is the Paradox of Market Competition"](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/234559)&mdash;or a pathway toward successful innovation&mdash;["The Way to the Future Through Collaboration: Tinkering With the Bounds of What's Possible"](http://www.wired.com/insights/2014/05/way-future-collaboration-tinkering-bounds-whats-possible/)&mdash;or simply a better way to work and retain employees&mdash;["Collaborate for Real: turning the lingo of collaboration into everyday practice"](https://hbr.org/2015/09/collaborate-for-real). In theory, this attention makes sense. Collaboration requires individual workers to reach beyond their particular skills and knowledges and act as more than input-output devices. When done right and well, collabortion results in interdependence amongst workers, thereby magnifying the abilities of individuals and producing new collective competencies. As such, collaboration appears as a marker of a healthy work environment, a stimulating workplace, a pathway for continued capital growth, and, better yet, one that seems to be in the best interest of workers. 

>But what if collaboration isn't all it is cracked up to be?

While collaboration is not a new concept in work settings,[^1] recent attention to collaboration attends to various contemporary workplace issues. In an era of reduced budgets, thin margins, and lagging workforce development, legacy ideas like re-tooling manufacturing (e.g. automating car production lines) or mitigating supplychain loss (e.g. vertically integrating production) seem insensitive to current issues. Amongst the issues plaguing contemporary companies, two issues seem to be most salient with respect to collaboration: human retention in an age of wage austerity and competitor saturation in a rapidly changing marketplace. Both issues stem from the conditions of global capitalism, and seem impossible to be address through simply cutting costs or doing more. Instead, the prevailing logic is that companies need to differentiate[^2] products or disrupt[^3] existing conditions through attention to how they make what they make. In short, the key to business success lies in a different approach&mdash;namely, a creative approach&mdash;to day-to-day work in combination with critical reframing of what it is a company makes, all of which needs to happen as low or no cost. 

In this milieu, collaboration has a strategic foothold. As an activity, collaboration is understood as capable of producing new ideas and outcomes without necessarily hiring new employees or building new hard infrastructure. Put bluntly, collaboration is a strategy to make the most of existing workers (and more often to make the most of workers' brains). To do so, collaboration is both a work style (how work occurs) and a work ethos (how work *should* occur). In both respects, the term seems to be a rather uncontestable notion, at least in the current moment of neoliberalized capitalism. As a work style, collaboration values the existing works. As a work ethos, collaboration parallels other socially minded ideas, such as the global citizen ("Think Global, Act Local") or the conscientious employer (take Tom's shoes for example). In both regards, collaboration seems to herald workers as the collective savior of a company.

For a company or corporation, valuing collaboration makes good sense in terms of both corporate strategy and human resources. Collaboration holds the potential for new business opportunities through additive and synergistic work. Collaborative settings offer workers the ability to learn from others and potentially exercise creative thinking skills as they find ways to create output that would be impossible in sequential or individuated work. As such, a collaborative workplace purports to transform individuals in a collective by sharing responsibilities, as well as mitigating slow-downs by the same token. In theory, collaboration requires the supression of egos, which from the corporate standpoint means a workforce might be more aligned with collective values (and hopefully those of the company itself). By moving beyond a single-minded approach to work (i.e. a cog in a machine), individual workers participate in a performed collective identity that is not parsable to its individual parts.

Beyond the stated goals of collaborative workplaces, attention to collaboraton cannot be separated from its potential shadow on a workforce. The very means of what makes collaboration useful and important to companies&mdash;namely, distributing responsibility and tasks in the hopes of synergy&mdash;are also the means through which collaboration can be a regime of control. With teams working in more integrated ways, individual workers no longer retain sole ownership over particular skills, outputs, or ideas. As much as distribution reduces bottlenecks and redundancies, it also acts as a type of de-/re-skilling. As teams build capacities, ideas, and methods, the actions of individual workers dissolve into those of the group, leading to less and less individual ownership over the process. Instead, workers building particular relational skills within a micro-supplychain, that is, tacit knowledge of collaborating. Of course, this notion is culturally paradoxical&mdash;collaboration coincides with language of increasing employee ownership over the things they work on (["If you want employees to work like they own the company, then give them a stake in the game."](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/218028)). The point is not that collaboration is bad, but that collaboration can be euphemistic, even when done well. Like the term "workplace flexibility"[^2], collaboration seems to used in some ways to disguise efforts to disempower workers in the exact moment of claiming empowerment.

On the ground, the euphemism of collaboration takes on particular characteristics. In my dissertation fieldwork at a company called LTC, I heard over and again how LTC frequently flew the banner of collaboration, yet did little to support its day-to-day activity. Many workers found this nominal attention to collaboration frustrating. A particularly salient example comes from the performance review process. At LTC, performance reviews primarily focused on those projects an employee led, or what employees colloquially referred to as "owning a project." As such, the performance review process soured the potential for collaboration by disincentivized working on projects of which one could not claim ownership. Here performance reviews value leadership rather than compromise, ostensibly making collaboration a hindrance to promotion. Collaboration is a euphemism for following rather than leading. Skills like interpersonal communication are rendered invisible through LTC's nominal support of collaborative work. To collaborate is to sacrifice one's career through uncounted work.

Outside of a corporate setting, collaboration is a different euphemism. In my more recent research into coworking spaces, collaboration frequently appears as a selling point. Coworking offers workers of various sorts&mdash; independent entrepreneurs, freelancers, remote workers, and startups&mdash;the opportunity to colocate. By doing so, individuals can bump someone new, hopefully spurring on new thinking, new connections, and new opportunities for success. While I am sure this happens (I have yet to hear a truly compelling story), collaboration seems to have a new valance of standing in for jobs that are rife with "shadow work".[^5] 

At one of the first coworking spaces I visited, I spoke with Grant, a mid-40s remote employee working for a nonprofit. Grant explained he had done fund raising for this NGO for years, but previously had done so from a home office. Spending his days in his house, he felt cut off from the world, but also cut off from other workers. I asked whether he had colleagues in the space to which he responded that "nobody else is doing what I'm doing." I followed up by asking whether he found ways to work with others in the space, or was a coworking membership equated to separating home and work. He was emphatic that while no one else in the space did fund raising, he found ways to collaborate.

but frequently asks for help on the many other tasks he has been given. While Grant has been doing work for this non-profit for years, in recent years he has been given new tasks, such as maintain a portion of the website or announce events on Twitter. Grant knew about fundraising, and so all the added requirements were simply outside of the scope of his job five years ago. For Grant, collaboration is a requirement to do his job, a job that is simply impossible for one person to know all the components of. Unlike a traditional workplace, his coworking space served as an extend his ability to be an individual worker, while also giving into unreasonable job expectations. Here collaboration is a euphemism for a worker that doesn't exist.

Again, the point is not to disparage collaboration on the whole. As an ideal and activity, collaboration has an important place. Instead, what is at issue is whether collaboration as an ideal ever becomes an activity, and in those instances whether that activity actually meets the ideal. In these two examples, collaboration fails to find form. But the larger question is whether collaboration ever finds its form, or all too often is yet another euphemism for business as usual.

[^1]: For example, the now-familiar term brainstorming dates back to the 1940s and early 1950s when Alex F. Osborn (then working as marketing firm BBDO)introduced the concept in a series of books: *How to 'Think Up'* (1942), *Your Creative Power*(1948), and *Applied Imagination: Principles and Procedures of Creative Thinking.*(1953). As a technique for ideation, brainstorming requires individuals to build off of one another's (hopefully wild) ideas. In an attempt to simply produce a quantity of potentials, brainstormers refrain from judging or otherwise evaluating ideas in the hopes that something unexepected rises to the surface. As the description illustrates, brainstorming plays into a mythos of creativity as a wild, uncontrollable, and subconcious process, tapped into by dislocating the self from social norms and bounded mental states. While brainstorming has been [handedly criticized](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/01/30/groupthink), the idea points out that collaboration (and more broadly creativity) has long been a corporate strategy. According to the mythology, brainstorming saved BBDO from implosion by tapping new capacities in existing workers by building group capacities.
