In the business and management world, a great deal of attention is devoted to producing, supporting, and sustaining collaboration. Collaboration requires individual workers to reach beyond their particular skills and knowledges, and rely on other workers and competencies (I mean, at least in theory). Collaboration is a marker of a healthy work environment and a stimulating workplace. Collaboration is both a work style&mdash;how work occurs&mdash;and work ethos&mdash;how work *should* occur. As a concept, collaboration seems to be a rather uncontestable notion. But what if collaboration isn't all it is cracked up to be?

For a company, valuing collaboration makes good sense in terms of both corporate strategy and human resources. Collaboration holds the potential for new business opportunities through additive and synergistic work. Collaborative settings offer workers the ability to learn from others and potentially exercise creative thinking skills as they find ways to create output that would be impossible in sequential work. To borrow a metaphor from computing, in a collaborative environment individual workers are no longer responsible for input-output but parallel processes. As such, a collaborative workplace purports to transform individuals in a collective by distributing responsibilities and tasks differently, as well as mitigating bottlenecks and redundancies. In theory, collaboration requires the supression of egos, which from the corporate standpoint means a workforce more aligned with collective (rather than individual) values. By moving beyond a single-minded approach to work (i.e. a cog in a machine), individual workers participate in a performed collective identity that is not parsable to individual parts.

Popular treatment of collaboration makes it almost impossible to argue against collaboration. Yet unsurprisingly, the popular attention to this term, as popular attention to any term, leaves much to be desired. Collaboration is taken at face value, conjuring the stock image of individual workers united in a trust fall exercise. Collaboration assumes the form of an aspiration or an aphorism that can only be blasphemously countered. Collaboration is a term that seemingly embodies the workplace of the future. The problem is that the workplace of the future looks a lot like the workplace of the past.

One side of the invisibility of collaboration stems from the issue of showing work. The history of management reveals that management is often a practice of finding ways for workers to show what they are doing. A quintessential example is the time card. The time card requires workers to self-document their hours, ostensibly putting the responsibility of being paid on the workers to document properly. The time card is an absolute structure.

Collaboration presents an issue for management. While cogs in a machine are easily accounted for, compositional unit 


 In short, collaboration is yet another euphemism for business as usual.
