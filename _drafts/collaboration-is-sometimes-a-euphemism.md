In the business and management world, a great deal of attention is devoted to producing, supporting, and sustaining collaboration. It seems popular publications orbiting these domains often claim collaboration is a secret ingredient to market success&mdash;["Collaborate to Win is the Paradox of Market Competition"](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/234559)&mdash;or a pathway toward successful innovation&mdash;["The Way to the Future Through Collaboration: Tinkering With the Bounds of What's Possible"](http://www.wired.com/insights/2014/05/way-future-collaboration-tinkering-bounds-whats-possible/)&mdash;or simply a better way to work and retain employees&mdash;["Collaborate for Real: turning the lingo of collaboration into everyday practice"](https://hbr.org/2015/09/collaborate-for-real). In theory, this attention makes sense. Collaboration requires individual workers to reach beyond their particular skills and knowledges by relying on other workers and competencies. This interdependance, when done right and well, magnifies the abilities of individuals and produces new collective competencies. As such, business and management use collaboration is a marker of a healthy work environment, a stimulating workplace, and a pathway for continued capital growth because collaboration combines various pressing workplace issues from human retention in an age of wage austerity to redefining production in a rapidly changing and saturated global marketplace. Collaboration, as an activity as much as idea, combines these concerns through an illusive admixture for moving corporate objectives forward by refiguring existing capacities. In short, collaboration is a strategy to make the most of workers.

In simple terms, collaboration is both a work style&mdash;how work occurs&mdash;and work ethos&mdash;how work *should* occur. In both respects, the term seems to be a rather uncontestable notion, at least in the current moment of western neoliberalized capitalism. As a workplace ideal, collaboration parallels other socially minded ideas, such as the global citizen ("Think Global, Act Local") or the conscientious employer (take Tom's shoes for example). But what if collaboration isn't all it is cracked up to be?

For a company or corporation, valuing collaboration makes good sense in terms of both corporate strategy and human resources. Collaboration holds the potential for new business opportunities through additive and synergistic work. Collaborative settings offer workers the ability to learn from others and potentially exercise creative thinking skills as they find ways to create output that would be impossible in sequential, individuated work. As such, a collaborative workplace purports to transform individuals in a collective by subparcelling and sharing responsibilities, as well as mitigating slow-downs by the same token. In theory, collaboration requires the supression of egos, which from the corporate standpoint means a workforce might be more aligned with collective values (and hopefully those of the company itself). By moving beyond a single-minded approach to work (i.e. a cog in a machine), individual workers participate in a performed collective identity that is not parsable to its individual parts. But collaboration as a corporate strategy is clever in other ways.

Beyond the stated goals of collaborative workplaces, attention to collaboraton cannot be separated from its potential shadow effects on a workforce. The very means of what makes collaboration useful and important to companies&mdash;distribution of responsibility and tasks in the hopes of synergy&mdash;is also the means through which collaboration can be a regime of control. With teams working in more integrated ways, individual workers no longer retain sole ownership over particular skills, outputs, or ideas. As much as distribution reduces bottlenecks and redundancies, it also acts as a type of de-/re-skilling. As teams build capacities, ideas, and methods, individual workers own less and less of what it is they make as their actions dissolve into the group. Instead, workers building particular relational skills within a micro-supplychain. Of course, this notion is culturally paradoxical&mdash;collaboration coincides with language of increasing employee ownership over the things they work on (["If you want employees to work like they own the company, then give them a stake in the game."](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/218028)). The point is not that collaboration is bad, but that collaboration can be euphemistic, even when done well. As such, collaboration (like the term "workplace flexibility"[^1]) is used in some ways (and, maybe, in increasingly many ways) to disguise efforts to disempower workers.

In corporate settings, collaboration takes a particular toll on the individual worker. In my dissertation fieldwork, I heard over and again how the technology company I observed (called LTC) frequently flew the banner of collaboration, yet did little to support its day-to-day activity. This was most concisely summed up in the ways performance was assessed at the end of the year. Rather than focus on the various parts of projects one was involved in, performance reviews primarily focused on only those projects that an employee "owned," meaning was the lead on. As such, the performance review process soured the potential for collaboration as it disinsentivized working with others. While an employee could work on a variety of projects in which she is not the owner, doing so leaves a manager in control of evaluating the worth of that employee in an ad-hoc manner based on the outcomes of the projects. Here performance reviews value leadership rather than compromise. Even more, the many developed skills related to teamwork, carework, and interpersonal communication are nothing more than a backdrop to whether someone led or followed. Certainly under a different regime, performance reviews might be assessed with greater sensitivity to collaborative environments, however, changing the terms of assessment does not address the slippage between what collaboration seems to be and what it ends up being. Here collaboration is a euphemism for a work that doesn't count.

Outside of the corporate setting, collaboration is a similar, albeit different, euphemism. Collaboration represents the over-tasked worker. In my more recent research into coworking spaces, I frequently hear the language of collaboration as an important selling point for joining a space. For independent entrepreneurs, freelancers, and remote workers/teams, coworking grants workers the opportunity to bump into someone new, hopefully spurring on new thinking, new connections, and new opportunities for success. While I am sure this happens (I have yet to hear a truly compelling story), collaboration seems to have a new valance of standing in for jobs that are rife with shadow work. 

At one of the first sites I visited, I spoke with a mid-40s remote employee of a nonprofit that does work overseas named Grant. I asked Grant about his use of the space and whether he felt it was worth it. He explained that he doesn't share ideas on the core of his work&mdash;"Nobody else is doing what I'm doing"&mdash;but frequently asks for help on the many other tasks he has been given. While Grant has been doing work for this non-profit for years, in recent years he has been given new tasks, such as maintain a portion of the website or announce events on Twitter. Grant knew about fundraising, and so all the added requirements were simply outside of the scope of his job five years ago. For Grant, collaboration is a requirement to do his job, a job that is simply impossible for one person to know all the components of. Unlike a traditional workplace, his coworking space served as an extend his ability to be an individual worker, while also giving into unreasonable job expectations. Here collaboration is a euphemism for a worker that doesn't exist.

Again, the point is not to disparage collaboration on the whole. As an ideal and activity, collaboration has an important place. Instead, what is at issue is whether collaboration as an ideal ever becomes an activity, and in those instances whether that activity actually meets the ideal. In these two examples, collaboration fails to find form. But the larger question is whether collaboration ever finds its form, or all too often is yet another euphemism for business as usual.
