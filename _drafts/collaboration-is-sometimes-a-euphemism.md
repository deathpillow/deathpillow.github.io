Collaboration is most often a marker of a healthy work environment. Indicative of both a supression of egos and a sharing of insights, collaboration requires individual workers to reach beyond their particular skills and knowledge, and rely on other workers and competencies. For a company, valuing collaboration makes good sense in terms of both corporate strategy and human retention. On one side, collaboration holds the potential for new business directions through additive and (ugh) synergistic means. To borrow a metaphor from computing, individual workers are no longer responsible for input-output but parallel processes. As such, a collaborative group points to   as well as distribute the responsibility of work, thereby mitigating individuated bottlenecks and redundancy.
