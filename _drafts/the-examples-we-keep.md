In a noisy restaurant, Steve traces the contours and history of social science research at LTC. [^1] In the first third of the interview we slide into discussing the ways in which social science research (now cast as "user experience research") is often discounted. There is something fitting about how quickly this becomes the topic of discussion. During my stint at LTC, much of my job as a user experience researcher focused on bolstering arguments against discounting user experience research within the product development process. I was tasked on numerous occasions with making videos, presentations, and back-up slides that served no purpose other than to be deployed if certain counter-arguments arose. As one colleague put it in a staff meeting while referring to the development of a central body around UX, the goal is to avoid arbitrary decisions. By this she meant decisions which assume that user experience research (and social science research more broadly) are nothing more than opinions. She continued that the central UX body is a "way to protect our decisions [in order to] lead our strategy and decision-making from the user-experience perspective". (fieldnotes, 07.17.2013) I share my observation that often the arguments leveraged against this form of research follow a particular trope: *Well, my wife...* Steve responds with a laugh: 

>What’s interesting about the wife example...It started out as, ah, let me see if I can get this right. In the '90s, people [would] say "Well, my grandmother wouldn't do this." And then, as time went on, it was "My wife won't do this." Now it’s "My daughter won't do this." So basically it’s always a woman who doesn't understand something. And it’s always a woman relative to them [...] relative to their position, right.

[^1] LTC is a large technology company and the main protagonist in my dissertation work.

Hold:
Steve is a well-respected and long-established social science researcher at the company. Having only recently found out about my work (more of an oversight on my part than anything else), Steve asked to be interviewed. This is a daunting request for a few reasons, the biggest being that in many ways Steve is a Prometheus of social science research at LTC. In other words, if anyone is going to tell me I am off in my analysis *and* I am going to take it to heart, it's going to be Steve. The interview with Steve is Tracing his career, Steve often reaches back many years to frame current behavior as both confounding and deeply-seated. Over and over Steve reminds me that what I observed at LTC with regards to user experience
