In a noisy tapas restaurant in Atlanta, Steve provides some historical perspective on social science research at his company. Steve works at LTC, a multinational computational technology company that has long specialized in engineering and manufacturing components and subsystems for computing systems. I spent six-months at LTC, embedded as a user experience researcher in order to observe the work practices of designers, engineers, managers, and other employees. While LTC is known for engineering, engineering does not necessarily account for the social, historical, or cultural processes important to understanding and making new computing products. As such, over the last twenty years, LTC has increased the number of social science researchers to provide insight as much as attention to concerns outside of the scope of engineers. In recent years, social science research has fallen under the label of "user experience," an amorphous term and agenda that foregrounds the situated, contingent, and lived realities of users of computational systems. While I learned a great deal about the company's relationship with the social sciences while at LTC, Steve offers his lived experience of the many growing pains of working in an environment that was and is hostile to his contribution to the design and development of computational systems.[^1]

Much of what Steve tells me is  recounted how his position as a human factors engineer morphed over time from mitigating errors to improving usability to supporting the desireous and aspirational qualities of people with products. Recently, his focus had become known as user experience&mdash;an amorphous and wide-reaching charge to understand current and future products in more comprehensive and contextual ways. Steve, like many other employees, told me that user experience was simultaneously discounted and desired within LTC. UX challenged many accepted assumptions, and required teams to be accountable to new ways of doing product design and development. While UX design and research offered intriguing opportunities for the company (at these opportunities were why it was introduced), employees struggled with having their core assumptions cast aside, both in terms of what to make and how to make it. As such, a variety of measures were put in place "to protect [UX designers' and researchers'] decisions [in order to] lead our strategy and decision-making from the user-experience perspective". (fieldnotes 07.17.2013, UX Council meeting [Katrine])

During my field work, I often witnessed how UX was challenged. One of the most prevalent ways of discounting proposals took the form of *Well, my wife...* followed by some form of rebuttal. I asked Steve about this trope, and he responded with a laugh: 

>What’s interesting about the wife example...It started out as, ah, let me see if I can get this right. In the '90s, people [would] say "Well, my grandmother wouldn't do this." And then, as time went on, it was "My wife won't do this." Now it’s "My daughter won't do this." So basically it’s always a woman who doesn't understand something. And it’s always a woman relative to them [...] relative to their position, right.

Within the computational technology industry, the disparity between male and female employees is rather well documented (along with disparities related to persons of color, class, and geographic representation).
