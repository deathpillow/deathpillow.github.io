The first Atlanta Food Data Hack took place March 9th, 2013. It was a 1-day event that brought together designers, programmers, farmers and food producers, advocates and entrepreneurs to conceptualize and prototype new uses of information and communication technology in support of local food issues and food systems.

Through this event we explored ways that digital media could be used to support local food initiatives and to grow a community of producers and stakeholders committed to open government.

The event was a platform for bringing together a individuals, organizations, data, tools, and desires that might be combined and committed to ongoing design work for local food systems: it was experiment in what we call public design.

Organizers included: City of Atlanta Office of Innovation Delivery, Atlanta Food Bank, Atlanta Local Food Initiative (ALFI), and the Public Design Workshop.

Concepts developed from the 1st Food Data Hack have been further developed in subsequent hackathons, courses, and independent projects with local organizations.
