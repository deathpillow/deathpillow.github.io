In May, I presented at the 67th annual International Communication Association (ICA) conference in San Diego. My presentation/paper, entitled "Designing Participation: On the intermediation and branding of civics", was part of a panel with Andrew Schrock, Burcu Baykurt, and Laura Forlano, entitled "The Civic Technology Movement: Intervening in Designing Cities."

At the time of proposing the panel (Oct 2016; see panel proposal below), I had only begun to think through the design of smart city convenings and the role of these events in constructing shaping contemporary approaches to participation.

Initially, I thought of these convenings&mdash;the wide array of civic hackathons, smart city agenda-setting meetings, conferences () (such as NIST's Global City Teams Challenge Expo) and gatherings

By smart city convenings, I am referring to a variety of different events&mdash;civic hackathons, ranging from national events like [AT&T's Hackathon Invitational Challenge](http://www.webcitation.org/6tA0oS3aQ) or local events like the Metropolitan Atlanta Regional Transit Authority (MARTA) Hackathon series ([#3](http://www.webcitation.org/6tA0yaqoa)); summits and conferences, such as [the Gigabit City Summit](http://www.webcitation.org/6tA1L2e0A) and [Smart Cities Week]()
