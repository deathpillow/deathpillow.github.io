In May, I presented at the 67th annual International Communication Association (ICA) conference in San Diego. My presentation/paper, entitled "Designing Participation: on the intermediation and branding of civics", was part of a panel with Andrew Schrock, Burcu Baykurt, and Laura Forlano, entitled "The Civic Technology Movement: Intervening in Designing Cities."

At the time of proposing the panel (Oct 2016; see panel proposal below), I had only begun to think through the design of smart city convenings and the role of these events in constructing shaping contemporary approaches to participation.

By smart city convenings, I am referring to a variety of different events:
- civic hackathons, ranging from national events like [AT&T's Hackathon Invitational Challenge](https://devsummit.att.com/hackathon-invitational) or local events like the Metropolitan Atlanta Regional Transit Authority (MARTA) Hackathon series ([live link](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/marta-hackathon-rider-experience-design-thinking-tickets-36606813966?aff=erelexpmlt); [archive link](http://www.webcitation.org/6tA0yaqoa));
- summits and conferences, such as [the Gigabit City Summit](http://www.webcitation.org/6tA1L2e0A) and [Smart Cities Week]()
