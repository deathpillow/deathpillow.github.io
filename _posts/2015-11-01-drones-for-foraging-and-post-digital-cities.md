###City in Question podcast, episode 2

In this episode, I speak with Dr. Carl DiSalvo, an associate professor of Digital Media at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Carl explains his project *Drones for Foraging*, "a design project that explores the use of DIY and hobbyist drones in support of urban foraging." [[source]](http://dronesforforaging.com). With his project as a starting point, Carl and I discuss how this particular use of hobbyist drones reveals issues for how we imagine computation in the future and the role of designers in shaping our imagined urban landscape.
