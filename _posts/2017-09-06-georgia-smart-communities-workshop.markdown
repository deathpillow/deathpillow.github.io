The Georgia Smart Communities Workshop was an event designed to better understand the opportunities, barriers, and needs within local governments related to implementing pilot smart technology projects (often called "smart city projects") across the state of Georgia.[^1] The workshop served had two goals:

1. Educate local government stakeholders about smart communities
2. Assess the viability of a state-wide pilot program

These two goals meant that the workshop served as a context to foster multiple touch points between local governments[^2] and a consortium of advocacy and educational stakeholders (including Georgia Tech). For the first goal, the workshop provided definitions, state and national best practices, case studies of successes and failures, and peer learning opportunities through a keynote, a panel discussion, and small group activities and networking. For the second goal, the workshop was means to collect quantitative and qualitative data in order to establish empirically-informed terms, conditions, and requirements for a state-wide technical assistance program to support smart community pilots.[^3] In other words, the workshop was both an __outcome__ (for educating) and a __methodology__ (for data collection).

The following documentation gives an overview of the design of the Georgia Smart Communities Workshop, with an emphasis on the ideation activity that took place in the afternoon. This latter portion of the workshop engaged participants in activities used to gather data while educating local government employees about design thinking. In this case study, the term _we_ refers to me (as lead designer) and [Carl DiSalvo](http://carldisalvo.com).

### The Design of the Workshop as a Methodology ###

In planning this workshop, we mapped out the various moments in which participants could be engaged and data could be collected (see Figure 1). For the latter goal&mdash;that is, using the workshop as a methodology&mdash; meant that the ongoings of the event needed to documented and analyzed. As such, __two parts needed to be designed: the role of facilitators and the materials that produce data traces.__

Where the workshop constituted the learning context, we realized data collection started prior to the event. During registration, we were able to correlate sign-ups with census data about cities and counties based on their listed affiliation.

In standard protocol of running a workshop, we sent reminders to participants about day-of logistics (e.g. where to park, directions, and schedule of events) a few days prior to the event. We saw this as an opportunity to circulate a pre-survey, and a second moment collect data prior to the workshop. The pre-survey was hosted on Google Forms and asked a few questions related to on how knowledgeable participants were of the topic (smart communities/cities) and what local challenges motivated their interest in attending. We had a response rate of about 42%. This preliminary data helped inform the afternoon activity.

### Ideation Activity: Define + Specify + Propose ###

On the outset, the afternoon activity was loosely defined. The goal was to collect data about the state of smart communities across Georgia. Given the two goals of the workshop, we felt this afternoon activity also should serve as an educational opportunity.

Based on our previous work doing public workshops (such as [GrowBot Garden](http://publicdesignworkshop.net/portfolio/growbot-garden/)), we set a constraint that the afternoon activity should focus on ideation without engaging in methods unfamiliar to the participants. From experience with local government stakeholders, activities such as sketching, low-fidelity prototyping, or other constructivist activities required high engagement with facilitators. With only two facilitators staffing the afternoon, these activities weren't feasible. As such, we decided to employ a worksheet based design thinking activity we experimented with in a previous workshop series with social entrepreneurs.

[^1]: The Georgia Smart Communities Workshop was held on July 21st 2017 and took place at the Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC) offices. The event was organized by Georgia Institute of Technology in partnership with ARC, Association County Commissioners of Georgia (ACCG), Georgia Municipal Association (GMA), Georgia Centers for Innovation, Metro Atlanta Chamber, and Technology Association of Georgia (TAG). The workshop convened local governments, government associations, and industry and academic leaders to discuss the application of various computational and digital technologies (e.g. Internet of Things (IoT) devices, intelligent infrastructures, data centers, public wireless, information and communications technologies (ICTs), and more) for local government. These types of technology projects and initiatives often fall under the label of smart cities&mdash;a label that presumes that individual municipal governments are the primary governmental actors in such efforts. Although this presumption tends to be true, its truth depends on a host of external factors that bolster the prominent role of cities (and often large cities) in such efforts&mdash;[an increased focus on metropolitan areas as sites of innovation](https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Creative-Class-Transforming-Community/dp/1469281422); the ability for municipal governments to participate in [various technical assistance programs](https://gtcui.wordpress.com/2016/04/11/a-reaction-to-technology-and-the-future-of-cities-uneven-development-and-expertise-in-the-smart-city/) and [policy networks](https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/fast-policy); [the repeated meme that global population is becoming and will increasing become concentrated in cities](http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/news/population/world-urbanization-prospects-2014.html). The Georgia Smart Communities Workshop, on the other hand, fostered discussion about these sorts of projects and technologies at different local government scales. In Georgia, the presumed smart city is Atlanta. As such, the workshop brought together cities, counties, and conglomerated city-county governments from across the state to discuss the application of technologies and policy initiatives we call _smart communities_.
[^2]: The workshop drew more than 70 participants, including personnel from 20 city governments, 8 county governments, 8 community improvement districts, and 8 US congressional districts. These participants were spread across about a fifth of Georgia counties.
[^3]: The program, called Georgia Smart Communities Challenge, or Georgia Smart, is still being developed in full as of early September 2017.
