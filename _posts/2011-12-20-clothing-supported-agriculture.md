Clothing Supported Agriculture is a design project that explored how non-agricultural objects can embody the values of agriculturalists. After a lengthy period of ethnographic research, the project focused on clothing. The end results are a series of constructed garments, a website, and series of videos that embody notions of sustainability, locality, and best practices. The final deliverables are framed in the style of an internet lookbook and social entrepreneur company. 

Clothing Supported Agriculture was done in collaboration with Sarah Fox and within the Public Design Workshop, led by Carl DiSalvo.
