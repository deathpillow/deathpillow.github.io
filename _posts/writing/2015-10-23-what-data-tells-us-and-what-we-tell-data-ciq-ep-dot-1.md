###City in Question podcast, episode 1

CycleAtlanta is an application for submitting bicycle routes to Atlanta city and regional planners in order to aid in creation of cycling infrastructure. The app heralds a shift in how planners as much as people can participate in local government. This week I talk to Chris LeDantec and Mariam Asad about the project, and what it tells us about the city as a landscape of data.
