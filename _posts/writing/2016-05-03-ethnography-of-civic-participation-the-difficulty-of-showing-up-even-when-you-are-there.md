My contribution to the ["Data, Design and Civics: Ethnographic Perspectives"](https://www.epicpeople.org/tag/datadesigncivics-series/) series edited by Carl DiSalvo for the Ethnographic Praxis in Industry Conference. The article focuses on some early reflections on structural issues with contemporary civic participation.
