I am currently a Research Scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology in the [Institute for People and Technology(IPAT)](http://ipat.gatech.edu) and the [Center for Urban Innovation](http://www.urbaninnovation.gatech.edu/).

I am received my PhD from the [Digital Media program](http://dm.lmc.gatech.edu/) at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where was a member of the [Public Design Workshop](http://publicdesignworkshop.net).

I reside in Atlanta, Georgia with Sara, Rosa, and Saint Francis.

### Research ###

My research focuses on (1) the future of work and (2) smart cities and civic technology. I am interested in the open government data, the professionalization of civic hacking, smart city technical assistance, and flexible work practices. I focus on questions related to design&mdash;how concerns are conceptualized, scaffolded, and represented&mdash;and affect&mdash;the embodied and relational qualities of activities, people, and situations.

I approach these interests through the lenses of the humanities, media and communications, design research, urban studies, human-computer interaction, and science and technology studies.  I take influence from workplace ethnographies, affect theory, production studies, and policy research.
